Build an AI Foundry chatbot that answers FAQs using Azure OpenAI and demonstrates clear, 
consistent conversations for common user questions.
Create a chatbot in AI Foundry that provides clear, consistent answers to frequently asked

unknown or unclear queries politely without guessing. Demonstrate the bot using a set of 
sample questions and show how it maintains reliable behavior across different user prompts.
